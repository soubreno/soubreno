### My name is Breno Marques, I'm 28 years old and I was born in Rio de Janeiro. I currently live alone. I'm looking for a vacancy in the web development area, which I've been studying for a few months, and which I've always been passionate about.

I am quite enthusiastic about hardware, equipment and technologies.

My passion led me to start working in a lan house at the age of 14. Managing all aspects of customer service such as: IT assistance, mobile recharge, printing, photocopying and computer maintenance.

As I really enjoy reading and am curious, I enrolled in the History course at PUC-RIO. However, a short time later, I did not see myself being a Historian or Professor of History. I always wanted to study some area that was related to the experiences I had at the lan house.

It took me a while to demystify a myth that always said that the technological area was for very intelligent people or very good people with mathematics. Until, in September 2021, after the pandemic, I met Professor Bonieky Lacerda's company B7Web. A study platform very well evaluated by its students and with complete and high quality content from many programming languages.

As a result, I was drawn to programming for its ability to help people get their dreams off the ground. I have knowledge in: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Styled-Components, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 4 and currently learning React.js

That said, I'm looking for my first job opportunity, with the objective of growing professionally and also being able to contribute to the company's growth. :smile:
